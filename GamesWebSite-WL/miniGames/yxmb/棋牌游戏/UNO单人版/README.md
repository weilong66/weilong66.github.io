# UNO-offline-game
Inspired by UNO (https://uno-online.io/) - a popular card game designed for players of all ages, typically played with 2â€“10 participants.
The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a set number of points, usually by eliminating all the cards in your hand while strategically using action cards to disrupt opponents.
